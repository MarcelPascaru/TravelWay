                        in the Atlantic Ocean and across the Mediterranean Sea.[12][h] The largest part of Spain is
                        situated on the Iberian Peninsula; its territory also includes the Canary Islands in the
                        Atlantic Ocean, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, the autonomous cities of Ceuta
                        and Melilla, and several minor overseas territories also scattered along the Moroccan coast of
                        the Alboran Sea.[13] The country's mainland is bordered to the south by Gibraltar; to the south
                        and east by the Mediterranean Sea; to the north by France, Andorra and the Bay of Biscay; and to
                        the west by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean.

                        <p class="tradition-text">
                            Bullfighting, the most controversial of Spanish traditions, is a mixed blessing for Spain.
                            Many tourists are very curious to see it and view it as a fascinating insight into Spanish
                            culture, but it is also a stain on the country's reputation for others. Bullfighting is
                            nowhere near as popular as it used to be, but it still features prominently in the country's
                            self-image. In 2017, the tradition got a tourism boost because of the release of 20th
                            Century Fox's movie "Ferdinand," which features a ​bull who no longer wants to fight the
                            matador as the main character. While you can still experience these traditional bullfights
                            in many cities across Spain, the sport is dwindling.

                            Paella is considered to be a national dish of Spain. If someone asks you to name the top 3
                            Spanish dishes, your first thought most likely will be Spanish paella.

                            This widely worshiped Spanish rice dish is the all-time most famous dish in Spain.
                            This iconic Spanish food originates from the Spanish region of Valencia but it is eaten all
                            over Spain. No visit to Spain is complete without tasting paella.

                            Ah, you might like to know, paella in the Valencian language means pan.Spanish paella is
                            traditionally flavored with Spanish saffron and rosemary.

                            Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez (n. 6 iunie 1599,[2][3][4][5] Sevilla, Spania – d. 6
                            august 1660,[4][5][6][7] Madrid, Spania) a fost unul dintre cei mai cunoscuți pictori
                            spanioli din sec. XVII-lea. Reprezentant al stilului baroc, s-a remarcat în special ca
                            portretist la curtea regelui Filip al IV-lea al Spaniei. În același timp, Velázquez este
                            creatorul unei noi viziuni și al unui nou mod de zugrăvire a naturii. Acest lucru a
                            determinat ca, la sfârșitul secolului al XIX-lea, majoritatea impresioniștilor să valorifice
                            în pictura lor moștenirea lui Velázquez.

                            palaces, this Moorish pleasure palace will still take your breath away. The Nasrid dynasty's
                            royal palace is the artistic highlight of Spain's Islamic period, when Al-Andalus – as they
                            called Andalucía – represented the epitome of culture and civilization in Europe's Middle
                            Ages.

                            You really have to see this building to believe it – no photograph has ever done justice to
                            this symphony of shapes, so alive that they seem ready to take wing. American architect
                            Frank Gehry used blocks of limestone and undulating sheets of titanium to turn the notion of
                            modern architecture on its ear.
                            So thoroughly did he succeed that two new terms were born from it: "The Bilbao Effect" – the
                            ability of a city to turn its fortunes around by constructing a single world-class building
                            – and "architourism," a whole segment of the travel industry revolving around landmarks of
                            contemporary architecture. Inside the museum are traveling exhibitions and rotating displays
                            of its own collections of modern art.

                            Moorish, Gothic, and Renaissance architecture mingle and blend into a city that El Greco
                            captured in one of his most famous paintings. High on a granite hill and surrounded on three
                            sides by the deep gorge of the Tagus River, it presents a stunning profile; approaching it
                            from below is an unforgettable sight.

                            The layout of the town, with its irregular pattern of narrow streets and numerous blind
                            alleys, reflects its Moorish past, and the architecture of the Christian period is
                            represented by the numerous churches, convents, and hospices. This makes the old city a kind
                            of open-air museum, illustrating the history of Spain, and it has been listed by UNESCO as
                            part of mankind's cultural heritage.
