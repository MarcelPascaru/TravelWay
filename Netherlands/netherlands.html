                        Netherlands.[17][18][19] In Europe, the Netherlands consists of twelve provinces, bordering
                        Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, with maritime
                        borders in the North Sea with those countries and the United Kingdom.[20] In the Caribbean, it
                        consists of the three constituent countries Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, together forming

                            Another traditional feast of the Netherlands used to be ‘Koninginnedag’ (‘Queen’s day’).
                            This was celebrated in honour of the Queen’s birthday on April 30. Since April 2013 the
                            Netherlands has a king so Queen’s Day has been renamed ‘Koningsdag’ (‘King’s Day’) and is
                            celebrated on April 27, unless this date is on a Sunday, then it’s celebrated on the
                            preceding Saturday. Jumble sales or free-markets are traditionally held in the streets of
                            some city centres. The salespeople, including children, often wear orange clothes. The King
                            and his family visit two places somewhere in the country. Those places organize a special
                            program, displaying local folklore.

                            Pannenkoeken have remained a staple of local cuisine in the Netherlands for centuries, and
                            it’s not hard to see why. These hearty Dutch pancakes can be topped with sweet or savory
                            ingredients; such as bacon, salmon, apple, cheese, chocolate, powdered sugar, and stroop (a
                            treacly Dutch syrup). But don’t be fooled into thinking they are similar to the American or
                            Scotch variety, because they can be huge! As a result, they can be enjoyed as a main course
                            for lunch, dinner, or dessert – if you have room.

                            1] 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously
                            became one of the most famous and influential figures in Western art history. In a decade,
                            he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from
                            the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and
                            self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive
                            brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Not commercially successful, he
                            struggled with severe depression and poverty, eventually leading to his suicide at age
                            thirty-seven.

                        <p class="slide-text">
                            On the River Noord between Rotterdam and Dordrecht is the famous village of Kinderdijk
                            ("Children's Dike"), which takes its name from an incident during the St. Elizabeth's Day
                            flood of 1421 after a child's cradle had been stranded on the dike.

                            The big draw these days are the fantastically preserved 18th-century windmills. Now UNESCO
                            World Heritage Sites, the 19 Kinderdijk windmills, built between 1722 and 1761, are the
                            largest surviving concentration of windmills in the Netherlands.

                            Originally used to drain the fenlands, these majestic buildings with their impressive
                            92-foot sails are open to the public from April to October, including special Mill Days when
                            the sails are set in motion. These picturesque windmills make for a fun excursion for those
                            based in Rotterdam during their Netherlands stay.

                            Among the most beautiful villages in the Netherlands are the small hamlets along the
                            Ijsselmeer (Lake Ijssel), the freshwater lake that resulted from the closing of the sea
                            entrance to the Zuider Zee. These towns flourished during Amsterdam's Golden Age, when they
                            had access to the Atlantic and prospered as fishing and trade centers, but lost importance
                            as the harbors silted up.

                            Today, they're among the most photographed tourist attractions in the country. Time seems to
                            have stood still for the fishing village of Marken and the seaports of Volendam and
                            Enkhuizen, where many of the colorful houses have become museums and shops.

                            Enkhuizen has preserved many of its buildings and seafaring industries in the open-air
                            Zuiderzee Museum, where the cultural heritage and maritime history of the old Zuiderzee
                            region is preserved. Here, you can see craftsmen at work learning old maritime skills. In
                            Volendam's harbor, you can see a collection of colorful old wooden boats.

                        <p class="slide-text">
                            Near the lovely old city of Utrecht, the fourth largest in the Netherlands, De Haar Castle
                            (Kasteel De Haar) is the largest fortification in the country.

                            This spectacular castle, built by the famous Dutch architect PJH Cuypers, required so much
                            land (it sits on a spectacular 250-acre park) that the entire village of Haarzuilens had to
                            be relocated to accommodate it. While the original castle site was established in the 14th
                            century, this newer structure dates from 1892 and is well worth taking the time to explore.

                            Inside, you'll be rewarded with impressive collections of antiques, furniture, paintings,
                            and tapestries, but it's the gardens that really draw the crowds – along with the castle's
                            fairy-tale looks.
