                        <p class="tradition-text">
                            An Austrian tradition, with roots in German history, is the cone of goodies handed to
                            children on the first day of school. When six-year-olds start school for the first time,
                            usually in first grade, they are given a big cardboard cone. Either parents or grandparents
                            are tasked with giving the child a decorated cone filled with candy, toys and school
                            supplies.

                            Originally the cone would be brought to the school and it would be hung up on a cone tree
                            marked with their name. Kids would be told a story that at school a tree is growing with
                            cones and when it is ripe, the kids are old enough and need to go to school.

                            This is supposed to make the first day of school, which can often be a stressful time for a
                            child, a little more fun.

                        <p class="food-text">
                            The Linzer Torte is another dish known far beyond the borders of Austria. It took its name
                            from Linz, the Upper Austrian capital, and is unique in the fact that it was the world’s
                            first cake recipe to appear in written form. The cake first became famous in 1822 when a
                            baker from Franconia, Johann Konrad Vogel, began working for Katharina Kress, the widow of a
                            Linz confectioner. And that was the beginning of a success story. Today, the Linzer Torte is
                            just as well known abroad as the Sacher Torte and no less popular as a delicious city
                            souvenir.

                        <p class="art-text">
                            Musil was born in Klagenfurt, Carinthia, the son of engineer Alfred Edler von[1] Musil
                            (1846, Timișoara – 1924) and his wife Hermine Bergauer (1853, Linz – 1924). The orientalist
                            Alois Musil ("The Czech Lawrence") was his second cousin.[2]

                            Soon after his birth, the family moved to Chomutov in Bohemia, and in 1891 Musil's father
                            was appointed to the chair of Mechanical Engineering at the German Technical University in
                            Brno and, later, he was raised to hereditary nobility in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was
                            baptized Robert Mathias Musil and his name was officially Robert Mathias Edler von Musil
                            from 22 October 1917, when his father was ennobled (made Edler), until 3 April 1919, when
                            the use of noble titles was forbidden in Austria.

                        <p class="slide-text">
                            To the east of St. Veit, on a crag rising some 160-meters above the valley, sprawls the
                            imposing Burg Hochosterwitz, Austria's most important medieval castle. After a turbulent
                            history, the castle-first mentioned in 860 AD-was captured by the Khevenhüllers, and was
                            enlarged in 1570 in the face of Turkish invaders. Never captured by a foe, the castle has
                            remained in the Khevenhüller family since.

                            The steep access road to the castle, the Burgweg, winds its way up through the 14 defensive
                            gates to the beautiful arcaded courtyard where you'll find the little chapel with its wall
                            and ceiling paintings from 1570 and the church at the southwestern end of the castle with
                            its high altar dating from 1729.

                            The Grossglockner Hochalpenstrasse from Bruck, in the Pinzgau, to Heiligenblut, at the foot
                            of the Grossglockner, was constructed between 1930 and 1935. 

                            Although its importance as a route through the Alps has declined, it's still a splendid
                            highway through the Hohe Tauern, Austria's highest mountain massif and one of the country's
                            outstanding attractions. Running for 22 kilometers through the mountains at an altitude of
                            more than 2,000 meters, the road consists of a long succession of turns leading up to the
                            summit tunnel on the Hochtor at 2,506 meters and then down into the valley on the far side.

                            The Krimmler Ache plunges 380 meters in three tremendous cascades and makes for an excellent
                            excursion from the nearby village of Krimml. At an altitude of 1,076 meters, Krimml-perched
                            high above the Salzachtal in a wooded valley-is a wonderful place to stop for a few days if
                            you're into hiking.

                            In addition to various excellent walks to the waterfalls, there's a rewarding climb to the
                            Schettbrücke and continuing to the spectacular Krimmler Tauernhaus. From here, expert
                            climbers can tackle the 2,911-meter-high Glockenkarkopf on the Italian frontier.
