                    <p class="info-text">Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked country at the
                        confluence of Western, Central and Southern Europe. The country is a federal republic composed
                        of 26 cantons, with federal authorities based in Bern. Switzerland is bordered by Italy to the
                        south, France to the west, Germany to the north and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east.</p>
                    <p class="info-text">
                        Switzerland has a stable, prosperous and high-tech economy and enjoys great wealth, being ranked
                        as the wealthiest country in the world per capita in multiple rankings. The country has been
                        ranked as one of the least corrupt countries in the world, while its banking
                        sector has been rated as "one of the most corrupt in the world" paradoxically.

                        <p class="tradition-text">
                            The people of Basel like to say: "The best three days are when it's carnival." Venice –
                            beware!
                            Because Basel has the largest carnival in Switzerland.

                            Drummers, flautists, brass bands (known as guggenmusik to insiders), floats and carriages
                            parade
                            in the city centre. Creating a colourful hullabaloo, thousands of individuals disguised in
                            incredible costumes and carrying lanterns make for one of the greatest shows to be seen.
                            Early
                            birds and night owls are advised to be there for the start of the festivities when the
                            parade
                            kicks off at 4 o'clock in the morning. Pure magic...
                        </p>
                        <p class="tradition-text">
                            It remains unclear exactly why Carnival starts one week later in Basel than elsewhere in
                            Switzerland or Germany.

                            The common explanation is that after the Reformation in 1520, Basel continued celebrating
                            its Fasnacht, while the other regions officially stopped. It is said, that in order to
                            differ from the Catholic customs, Fasnacht was scheduled one week later starting in 1529.
                            There are no documents from this era supporting this theory, and the resolutions from 1529
                            were not quoted until 200 years later.

                        <p class="food-text">
                            Muesli, known in Switzerland as Birchermüesli, is a breakfast or snack consisting of cereal
                            (oat) flakes, chopped fruit and milk. There are countless variations with, for example,
                            honey, yoghurt and nuts. Muesli was created by the Swiss nutritionist Max Bircher-Benner at
                            the beginning of the 20th century. His 'apple diet dish', developed as part of a raw food
                            diet, was originally served to sanatorium patients as an easily digestible evening meal.
                            Nowadays muesli is a staple in Western breakfast culture and is especially popular among
                            athletes as a nutritional supplement.

                        <p class="art-text">
                            “In Switzerland, writing is only possible as an export business,” Friedrich Dürrenmatt, one
                            of the few internationally known Swiss authors, once remarked. The country’s small
                            population and four official languages have worked to make it difficult for any single
                            writer to enjoy widespread success or, perhaps more important, significant income, and most
                            Swiss writers are little recognized elsewhere in Europe. Even though Switzerland today
                            publishes thousands of books each year, many of the country’s literary successes date to
                            previous centuries with such figures as the Swiss-born French Enlightenment philosopher
                            Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the French-born memoirist and hostess Germaine de Staël, whose home
                            at Coppet became a centre of European literary life, and the noted 19th-century historian of
                            art and culture Jacob Burckhardt, whose Civilization of the Renaissance (1860) remains
                            influential.

                            In 1990, he gave two famous speeches, one in honour of Václav Havel ("Die Schweiz, ein
                            Gefängnis?/Switzerland a Prison?"), upon discovering he had been spied on for five decades,
                            along with 800,000 of his left-leaning fellow citizens, by the Swiss secret service;[3] the
                            other in honour of Mikhail Gorbachev ("Kants Hoffnung/Kant's Hope"). Dürrenmatt often
                            compared the three Abrahamic religions and Marxism, which he also saw as a religion.

                        <p class="slide-text">
                            Right on the shore of Lake Thun and surrounded by a 2.5-hectare park, this 13th-century
                            castle is one of the most breathtaking in Switzerland. Because Oberhofen Castle changed
                            hands many times through the centuries, and new owners kept adding rooms to it, the result
                            is a magical mix of many styles: Bernese Baroque-style buildings, Romantic style facades,
                            and Prussian-inspired exotic new areas (including a library and a smoking room).

                            The castle also houses a living museum showcasing the times and lives of feudal societies
                            that called the castle (and its surroundings) home from the 16th to the 19th centuries.

                            Over the following centuries the town, castle and herrschaft passed through several Bernese
                            patrician families. After the male line of the von Erlach family in Oberhofen died out in
                            1652, Bern acquired the castle and lands. They created the bailiwick of Oberhofen and
                            converted Oberhofen Castle into the administrative center for the bailiwick. Following the
                            1798 French invasion, Oberhofen am Thunersee became part of the Helvetic Republic Canton of
                            Oberland. After the collapse of the Republic and 1803 Act of Mediation it joined the newly
                            created Thun District.

                            Imagine a sparkling blue lake surrounded by mountains, a car-free medieval old town, covered
                            bridges, waterfront promenades, frescoed historic buildings, and sun-splashed plazas with
                            bubbling fountains. No wonder Lucerne (in German, Luzern) is a top spot for tourists.

                            Famed for its music concerts, this quintessential Swiss town lures renowned soloists,
                            conductors, and orchestras to its annual International Music Festival. The Culture and
                            Convention Center is home to one of the world's leading concert halls.

                            One of the city's most famous landmarks is the Chapel Bridge, built in the 14th century. In
                            a small park, lies the famous Lion Monument, a poignant sculpture of a dying lion, which
                            honors the heroic death of Swiss Guards during the attack on the Tuileries in the French
                            Revolution. History buffs will enjoy the Swiss Transport Museum with extensive exhibits on
                            all forms of transport, including air and space travel, railroad locomotives, and a
                            Planetarium.

                            For beautiful views of Lucerne, the Alps, and the lake, ride the funicular to the
                            Dietschiberg on the north side of Lake Lucerne; cruise up Mt. Pilatus on the cableway; or
                            head to the Rigi, a famous lookout point.

                        <p class="slide-text">
                            The Matterhorn, Switzerland's iconic pointed peak is one of the highest mountains in the
                            Alps. On the border with Italy, this legendary peak rises to 4,478 meters, and its four
                            steep faces lie in the direction of the compass points. The first summiting in 1865 ended
                            tragically when four climbers fell to their death during the descent. Today, thousands of
                            experienced climbers come here each summer.

                            At the foot of this mighty peak, lies the charming village of Zermatt, a top international
                            resort with horse-drawn carriage rides, quaint chalets, and world-class restaurants and
                            hotels. 

                            In the winter, skiers can schuss down more than 300 kilometers of slopes. In the summer,
                            swimming and tennis are popular pursuits, as well as hiking, biking, and climbing in the
                            surrounding mountains. Summer glacier skiing is also available.

                            The Matterhorn was studied by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure in the late eighteenth century,
                            who was followed by other renowned naturalists and artists, such as John Ruskin, in the 19th
                            century. It remained unclimbed after most of the other great Alpine peaks had been attained
                            and became the subject of an international competition for the summit.
