                        <p class="tradition-text">
                            Halloween or Hallowe'en (a contraction of "All Hallows' evening"),[5] less commonly known as
                            Allhalloween,[6] All Hallows' Eve,[7] or All Saints' Eve,[8] is a celebration observed in
                            many countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It
                            begins the observance of Allhallowtide,[9] the time in the liturgical year dedicated to
                            remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the departed.[10][11]

                            One theory holds that many Halloween traditions were influenced by Celtic harvest festivals,
                            particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain, which are believed to have pagan
                            roots.[12][13][14][15] Some go further and suggest that Samhain may have been Christianized
                            as All Hallow's Day, along with its eve, by the early Church.[16] Other academics believe
                            Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, being the vigil of All Hallow's
                            Day.[17][18][19][20] Celebrated in Ireland and Scotland for centuries, Irish and Scottish
                            migrants brought many Halloween customs to North America in the 19th century,[21][22] and
                            then through American influence, Halloween spread to other countries by the late 20th and
                            early 21st century.[23][24]

                            Every single American will have a different idea about where to find the best hamburger in
                            the country, ranging from fast food on the West Coast (In-N-Out Burger) to fine dining in
                            New York (The Spotted Pig). But only one place is recognised by the Library of Congress as
                            being the birthplace of hamburgers: New Haven, Connecticut. The year was 1900 and the
                            establishment was Louis' Lunch, run by one Louis Lassen. Today his great-grandson, Jeff
                            Lassen, guides the ship, which still serves burgers made from five-meat blend and cooked in
                            a century-old cast iron grill.

                        <p class="art-text">
                            Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter,
                            and dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural
                            figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance,
                            and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular
                            culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video
                            performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave
                            the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded individual music artist in history.

                            The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his
                            elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known
                            as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a
                            solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for "Beat It",
                            "Billie Jean", and "Thriller" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking
                            racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped
                            propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums Bad (1987),
                            Dangerous (1991), and HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995). Thriller became the
                            best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce five U.S. Billboard
                            Hot 100 number-one singles.[nb 1]

                            Yellowstone National Park is an American national park located in the western United States,
                            largely
                            in
                            the northwest corner of Wyoming and extending into Montana and Idaho. It was established by
                            the U.S.
                            Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872.
                            Yellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 sq mi (8,983 km2),[3] comprising lakes,
                            canyons, rivers, and mountain ranges.[10] Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest
                            high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the
                            largest supervolcano on the continent. The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has
                            erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years.
                            Well over half of the world's geysers[14][15] and hydrothermal features[16] are in
                            Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions
                            cover most of the land area of Yellowstone.

                            The Grand Canyon is a steep-sided canyon carved by the
                            Colorado River in Arizona, United States. The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446 km) long, up to
                            18
                            miles (29 km) wide and attains a depth of over a mile (6,093 feet or 1,857 meters).
                            The canyon and adjacent rim are contained within Grand Canyon National Park, the Kaibab
                            National
                            Forest, Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument, the Hualapai Indian Reservation, the

                            Indian Reservation and the Navajo Nation. President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent
                            of the
                            preservation of the Grand Canyon area and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy
                            the
                            scenery.
                            Nearly two billion years of Earth's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado
                            River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the
                            Colorado Plateau was uplifted.[7] While some aspects about the history of incision of the
                            canyon are debated by geologists,[8] several recent studies support the hypothesis that the
                            Colorado River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years
                            ago.

                        <p class="slide-text">
                            Niagara Falls is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge,
                            spanning the border between the province of Ontario in Canada and the state of New York in
                            the
                            United States. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls, also known as the Canadian
                            Falls, which
                            straddles the international border of the two countries. The smaller American Falls and
                            Bridal
                            Veil Falls lie within the United States. Bridal Veil Falls is separated from Horseshoe Falls
                            by Goat
                            Island and from American Falls by Luna Island, with both islands situated in New York.
                            Formed by the Niagara River, which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario, the combined falls
                            have the
                            highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than 50
                            m (160
                            ft).
                            Niagara Falls is 27 km (17 mi) northwest of Buffalo, New York, and 69 km (43 mi) southeast
                            of Toronto, between the twin cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York.
                            Niagara Falls was formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation (the
                            last ice age), and water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path over and through
                            the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean.
