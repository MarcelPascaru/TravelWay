                        Northern Europe, the mainland territory of which comprises the western and northernmost portion
                        of the Scandinavian Peninsula. The remote Arctic island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of
                        Svalbard also form part of Norway.[note 6] Bouvet Island, located in the Subantarctic, is a
                        dependency of Norway; it also lays claims to the Antarctic territories of Peter I Island and
                        Queen Maud Land. The capital and largest city in Norway is Oslo.

                        <p class="tradition-text">
                            You might already be familiar with the Norwegian delicacy of brown cheese, or brunost.

                            The “cheese” is sometimes called the country’s national cheese – but it actually isn’t a
                            cheese, technically.

                            Brunost’s unique production process, which consists of boiling cow or goat milk until it
                            caramelizes, leads to a gooey consistency and a sweet and salty taste – which many find
                            difficult to compare to any other food they’ve tried.

                            While the “cheese” itself has been around since before the current era, waffles topped with
                            brunost are a much more modern reimagining.
                            The meal can be eaten for breakfast, as a snack, or during teatime. Indulging in the cheese
                            is one of Norway’s most quintessential foodie experiences.

                        <p class="food-text">
                            Skillingsboller is a traditional Norwegian version of a cinnamon roll. This circular pastry
                            is usually associated with Bergen. The rolls are made with a combination of flour, milk,
                            yeast, eggs, sugar, cardamom, lots of butter, and chopped almonds (optional).

                            After the baking, skillingsbolle are brushed with additional butter on the top and the
                            bottom while they are still hot. The top is also sprinkled with extra sugar and cinnamon.
                            The name skillingsboller means penny bun. They're usually eaten as an afternoon snack with a
                            cup of coffee on the side, but some people like to eat them with brown cheese (Brunost).

                        <p class="art-text">
                            Edvard Hagerup Grieg was a Norwegian composer and pianist. He is widely considered one of
                            the
                            main Romantic era composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire
                            worldwide. His use and development of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions brought
                            the music of Norway to international consciousness, as well as helping to develop a national
                            identity, much as Jean Sibelius did in Finland and Bedřich Smetana in Bohemia.[1]

                            Grieg is the most celebrated person from the city of Bergen, with numerous statues which
                            depict his image, and many cultural entities named after him: the city's largest concert
                            building (Grieg Hall), its most advanced music school (Grieg Academy) and its professional
                            choir (Edvard Grieg Kor). The Edvard Grieg Museum at Grieg's former home Troldhaugen is
                            dedicated to his legacy.

                        <p class="slide-text">
                            The largest of Norway's fjords, Sognefjord reaches 204 kilometers inland from the coastal
                            village of Skjolden and branches off into countless smaller inlets and fjords along the way.
                            At its widest, the King of the Fjords (as it's known by Norwegians) is almost five
                            kilometers across, and the cliff walls reach as high as 1,307 meters, making a breathtaking
                            sight.

                            The most popular way to visit the fjord is by boat, and fjord cruises and sightseeing tours
                            are plentiful. Many of the best tour options depart conveniently from the attractive town of
                            Bergen (be sure to allow a full day for your adventure).

                            Tourists will also enjoy exploring the narrower branches like Naeroyfjord, a spectacular
                            17-kilometer stretch with cliff walls that are only 250 meters apart and tower more than
                            1,700 meters above the water.

                            A tourist attraction best suited for the active traveler thanks to the arduous journey
                            required to get there, Pulpit Rock (Preikestolen) is nevertheless one of the most popular
                            sights in Norway. Located near Stavanger, the destination requires ferry and bus rides and
                            then a two-hour uphill hike to reach the almost perfectly flat-topped cliff, which looks
                            over Lysefjord, more than 600 meters above the water.

                            Those visiting the Stavanger area will also want to stop by the surprisingly fascinating
                            Norwegian Canning Museum, which is set up as the cannery was during WWII. Stavanger
                            Cathedral is also a top tourist attraction in Stavanger. This 12th-century structure
                            features multiple styles, including a Romanesque basilica, a Baroque pulpit, and a Gothic
                            font.

                            The Akershus Fortress (Akershus Festning) is a medieval castle commissioned by king Håkon V
                            in 1299, later turned into a Renaissance royal residence by king Christian IV in the early
                            17th century. It sits on a promontory overlooking the Oslofjord, and the grounds have
                            spectacular views over the harbor.

                            Guided tours are available during the summer, and you can also find the Museum of the
                            Norwegian Resistance (Norges Hjemmefrontmuseum) ) on the castle grounds.

                            History buffs may also want to check out the Norwegian Armed Forces Museum (Forsvarsmuseet),
                            which displays weapons and exhibits illustrating Norway's military history. The fortress
                            grounds also provide a lovely backdrop for events including public ceremonies, concerts, and
                            shows.
